# Random-Forest
This code is an example of how to use a Random Forest classifier to predict the failure rate of companies based on various features.

The Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree in the Random Forest is built using a bootstrapped sample of the training data and a random subset of the features. The final prediction of the Random Forest is the majority vote of all the decision trees.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this code does:

* First, the code imports the necessary libraries and modules, including pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for machine learning algorithms, and matplotlib for data visualization.

* Next, the code creates an example dataset with 1000 observations, where each observation has features such as "revenue", "num_employees", "sector", and "failure_rate". The "sector" variable is encoded as binary variables using one-hot encoding.

* The code defines a failure threshold, which is used to convert the "failure_rate" variable into a binary variable based on whether it exceeds the threshold. The dataset is then split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module.

* The code creates a Random Forest classifier with 500 trees using the RandomForestClassifier class from the sklearn.ensemble module. The model is trained on the training set using the fit method.

* The code makes predictions on the test set using the predict method, and evaluates the performance of the model using various metrics, such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

* Finally, the code loads new data with features similar to those in the example dataset and makes predictions on the failure rate using the trained Random Forest model.
